TODO:
-----

=> Unit Test script: Latest_SI <= MAX_SI ; Latest notifications < 1y ago ; .. ?
=> Add more sources (Poland, Germany, Helsinki?)
=> Improve front end (check real estate websites) 
=> json page with login ('jsonify')
=> alert service (mail & SMS Twilio?) when total short interest breaks barriers
=> predictions based on short interest?


DATABASES:
----------
Per source:
=> In case of file: save file.
=> Raw source data in MIC.db
=> MIC.db to combine all raw source data, and add rules (<0.5% & 1y gap), and deduplicate.
=> Add all transformed data to AllNotifications.db

AllNotifications.db:
=> One long table with all transformed data, and one to catch checks (which should not be available)

ShortInterest.db
=> One table with historical data per share.


TRANSFORMATIONS
=> Notifications < 0.5%, next day on 0%.
=> Notifications with 1 year gap, next day on 0%.
=> Deduplicate: delete line of highest Short Interest
=> Transform Holder & Issuer into nice names.
